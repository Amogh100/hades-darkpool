HW4 Goal (as per proposal and Homework3.md description) "Implement Matching Algorithm. User Validation.". "There are no changes specified I would like to make to this plan. I do want to specify more on the matching algorithm as per the instructors request. This is a price-time priority algorithm, which manages a list of orders at a given price level (this list is structured so that orders are sorted by time of arrival). When an order on the opposite side arrives (opposite side for a BUY is a SELL, vice versa) and matches the limit price the order book will begin to fill orders so long as the crossing order has volume and is within its limit price if it's a limit order. For market orders, the book will have to immediately match to the best bid or ask depending on the side of the order. Moreover, there should be a separate order book per asset (so an orderbook for BTC, one for ETH, etc.). For more info and a specific example of the matching process refer to the Price-time priority/FIFO answer to this stack overflow question asking about various order matching algorithms. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13112062/which-are-the-order-matching-algorithms-most-commonly-used-by-electronic-financi"

1.) Goal (as per the original proposal) "Server that accepts orders over REST endpoint “/order”and puts them in an order book. 
Simple Order Entry Form. (No matching algorithm yet)"</br></br></br>
2.) The one minor change I have made was in my original class specification I had OrderGateway as a Singleton class; after studying more about the Spring Boot framework, I have come to understand that the @Controller annotation for a class(which OrderGateway uses) by default constructs a singleton underneath within the framework. See here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11508405/are-spring-mvc-controllers-singletons. I plan on making an OrderQueue class for HW4 to pipe orders to the relevant matching engine; this will be a singleton class that I will create as opposed to the framework creating it for me. Other than this, I have basically accomplished the goal for this homework, as the code currently has a simple order entry form that allows a (single)
user to enter orders through the "/order" endpoint, and the puts the order in a single order book. This was a relatively straightforward task. I even added
an additional feature that displays a table view of all open orders. This was done so that I can see all the orders
in the database without manually logging into the postgres instance and doing a "SELECT * from orders". This is going to have to get done in the future anyways, when querying open orders for a given user so I just went ahead and did it.</br></br></br>
3.) HW4 Goal (as per the original proposal) "Implement Matching Algorithm. User Validation.". There are no changes specified I would
like to make to this plan. I do want to specify more on the matching algorithm as per the instructors request. This is a price-time priority algorithm, which
manages a list of orders at a given price level (this list is structured so that orders are sorted by time of arrival) and when an order on the opposite side arrives (opposite side for a BUY is a SELL, vice versa) and matches the 
limit price the order book will begin to fill orders so long as the crossing order has volume and is within its limit price if it's a limit order. For market orders, the book will have to immediately match to the best bid or ask depending on the side of the order. Moreover, there should be a separate order book per asset (so an orderbook for BTC, one for ETH, etc.). For more info and a specific example of the matching process refer to the Price-time priority/FIFO answer to this stack overflow question asking about various order matching algorithms. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13112062/which-are-the-order-matching-algorithms-most-commonly-used-by-electronic-financi</br></br></br>
